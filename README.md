# 🏥 TrustHeal — AI + Blockchain Powered Digital Hospital

TrustHeal is a next-generation digital hospital infrastructure that combines **Artificial Intelligence** for medical intelligence and **Blockchain** for trust, privacy, and interoperability of health records.

It is designed to solve the biggest problems in healthcare today:

- Fragmented medical records
- Lack of trust between patients and providers
- Data privacy risks
- Inefficient diagnosis workflows
- No ownership of patient data

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Healthcare systems today suffer from:

- Medical data scattered across hospitals
- Patients having no control over their records
- Manual diagnosis and triage delays
- Data tampering risks
- No secure cross-hospital interoperability

A patient’s history is **critical**, yet inaccessible when needed most.

---

## 💡 The Solution

TrustHeal creates a **trust layer** using blockchain and a **decision layer** using AI.
